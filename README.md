<b>A glance to the Image-Processing</b>

in this project, I tried to use some basic methods of image processing with python and at the end, I made Qr-code detector 


***************************************************
-main codes are in the py files.<br>
-Used photos are in the IMAGES.rar<br>
-pdf files are just for showing results, nothing more.<br>
-QR is detected with two methods: image-segmentation and using pyzbar library<br>
