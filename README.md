A galance to the Image-Processing

in this project i tried to use some basic methods of image processing with python and at the end i made Qr-code detector 

kernel codes are in the .py files.

***************************************************
- Used images are in the IMAGES.rar
- In the QR-detector.pdf i detect Qr with two methods : image-segmentation and pyzbar library
- In the report.pdf simply i use basic methods with some optimization to show the results
